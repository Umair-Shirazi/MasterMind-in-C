###### Introduction

This is a C program that implements the Mastermind game. The program allows a player to guess a 4-digit number that has been randomly generated by the computer. The player has a certain number of tries to guess the correct number, and for each guess the computer will give feedback on how many digits are correct and how many are in the correct position.
The game function is the main function of the program, which generates the random 4-digit number, prompts the player to make a guess, and checks whether the guess is correct. If the guess is correct, the player wins the game. If the guess is incorrect, the player can make another guess until they either run out of tries or enter the correct number.
The player_guess function prompts the player to enter a 4-digit number, reads the input, and stores it in the b array.
The generate function generates a random 4-digit number and stores it in the a array.

The mastermind game is a board game that challenges players to crack a secret code using logic and problem-solving skills.
The goal of the game Mastermind is to defeat your opponent by correctly predicting the four digit number that they will use.
The game starts by entering the command line with the number of guesses allowed for the player (Usage : ./project 5). Where 5 is the maximum number of guesses.
After entering a four digit number, you will be given three responses: "correct and in the right position" (represented by a "1"), "correct but in the wrong place" (represented by "0"), and "not correct nor in the right place" (represented by ".").
"1", indicates that one of your entered digits matches one of the opponent's chosen digit and is in the same location as that digit.
"0" indicates that one of your chosen digits matches one of your opponent's chosen digits, but it is not located where his digits is.
If you leave it empty, an error message is displayed requesting another valid input.
As the game progresses, you will gather these results and be able to decipher your opponent's code.
It was both exhilarating and laborious, but in the end, I was able to duplicate this game in C.
The user/player can only input four digit numbers.
The system will generate a random number.
If a person wants to abruptly kill the program while it is running the user can enter the number"0000"

The program begins by entering the maximum number of guesses in the command line.
The code is divided into four major functions, namely;

generate()
player_guess()
game()
main()



###### generate()

This function generates a single digit and is enetered into a variable
Next this variable value is added to an array which contains 4 digits

###### player_guess()

This function takes the four digits entered by the user and uses division and MOD to enter the four digit number into an array to be used to check each digit later on in the program
This function is written inside an infinte while loop.
This loops the entire function infinite number of times until the user enters a valid number.
The validity of the number entered is checked and if it is accepted as a valid input the loop is broken


###### game()

This loops begins by printing the User Interface.
Next it calls the generate() function to generate a random four digit number.

Next it calls the player_guess function to get a valid input from the user.
Immediately as this begins, we call the player_guess () function to get the players guess so we can run the players guess through the program.
After this, we use a major IF loop to check if all four entered digits are exactly equal to the four generated digits.
If this criteria is not met it checks if the user has entered "0000" to kill the program
If Any of the above criteria is met the count is set to the maximum number of guesses hence stopping the while loop which is running the function
If non of these requirements are met multiple for loops are run to check each digit
Comparing each entered digit parallely with the generated code
If any of the digits entered are the same and in the right position, a variable named correct is incremeneted by one
Similarly if any of the digits entered are in the generated number but not in the correct position a variable named pos is incremented by one

Once this run for each digit multiple for loops are run to print the results
This is done by running a for loop for the number of times the variables correct and pos was incremented

###### main ()

The main function takes the maximum number of guesses from the command line and assigns it to a variable called max_guesses
Next the game() function is run to play the game
Once this is complete we ask if the user wants to play the game again
If the users eneters yes the game() function is run in an infinite while loop until the user enters no when promted to play the game again

###### Conclusion

In conclusion, the Mastermind game implemented in C successfully demonstrates the use of various programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions,command lines, and libraries
The game provides a fun and engaging way to test the player's logical thinking skills.
Overall, the project serves as a valuable learning experience for those interested in C programming and game development.
